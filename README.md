### Project Overview

This repo contains my submission for **Assignment 2** in the programming languages module. The assignment is titled **Teja Assignment 2** and includes:

- Reporting syntax and runtime errors in Python, JavaScript, and C++ (Part 1).
- Semantic comparisons of type systems, scope, and closures across these languages (Part 1).
- Memory management code and analysis in Rust, Java, and C++ (Part 2).
- Screenshots of code, error outputs, and corrected runs.
- A comprehensive report in PDF or DOCX format, with in-text citations and references.

### Motivation & Objective

I built this assignment to deeply understand how different programming languages handle errors, scope, typing, memory, and safety mechanisms. Doing this helps me see practical trade-offs that influence real-world system design.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

- Node.js (JavaScript runtime)

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

- Java JDK

- Rust toolchain (cargo)

- Optional: memory profilers like Valgrind, jvisualvm, or heaptrack for deeper analysis.
